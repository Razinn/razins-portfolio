Hello everyone! I'm Md. Jahidul Islam Razin, and I'm thrilled to share a bit about my journey and experiences with you all. I’ve always been passionate about IT and research, and over the years, I've had the opportunity to dive deep into various aspects of this field.

### My Professional Journey

**At Dnet,** where I served as an Executive & Data Coordinator from April 2022 to October 2023, I was deeply involved in some exciting projects. One of the highlights was the Citizen Portal Web & Mobile App Design and Development, funded by the World Bank. Here, I conducted extensive UX research, created detailed wireframes using Balsamic and Visio, and coordinated the project to ensure seamless execution. I also worked on the 360-degree Feedback Mechanism System for Brac Bank’s SME Division, focusing on data cleaning, report template design, and backend data analysis using SQL in DBeaver.

Additionally, I contributed to the Nutrition International Adolescent Health Project, conducting feasibility studies and coordinating the project to ensure timely completion. These experiences have honed my skills in project coordination, technical documentation, and user experience research.

**Before that, at Newroz Technologies Ltd,** I worked as a Junior Project Manager from August 2021 to December 2021. I was directly involved in managing e-wallet projects like Desi Pay and Globe Pay, where I focused on user experience analysis and project management, often stepping into the role of scrum master.

**My role as a Business Analyst at Dnet** from August 2020 to December 2020 also provided valuable insights. I worked on projects like the Citizen CPTU Portal and the UNICEF Adolescents Development Project, where I handled data analysis, desk research, and report writing.

### Educational Background

I completed my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Asia Pacific (UAP) in 2020, graduating with a GPA of 3.56/4.00. My thesis was on "An Automatic Violence Detection Technique Using 3D Convolution Neural Network," which was a challenging yet rewarding project.

### Publications

I’m proud to have my research published in notable journals. Some of my work includes:

- "An Automatic Violence Detection Technique Using 3D Convolution Neural Network" in Springer Nature.
- "A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Model for Business Sentiment Analysis Based on Recurrent Neural Network" also in Springer Nature.
- "Isolated Bangla Handwritten Character Classification using Transfer Learning," presented at the ICCA '22.

### Skills and Certifications

My technical skills span across several programming languages like C, C++, and Python, and analytical tools such as MS Office and PowerBI. I’m also skilled in web development, including HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, and SQL. On the project management front, I’m proficient with tools like Jira, Balsamiq, and Figma.

### Achievements and Volunteering

My passion for innovation earned me the 1st place at Startup Weekend Dhaka, powered by Google for Entrepreneurs. I’ve also received the VC Award and Dean's Award from UAP. Beyond my professional work, I’ve volunteered at various technical events like the ACM-ICPC and the Inter University Software and Hardware Carnival at UAP, and served as President and Vice President of the Career Development Club at UAP.

Thank you for listening! I’m excited about what the future holds and am always eager to connect with like-minded professionals and explore new opportunities.
